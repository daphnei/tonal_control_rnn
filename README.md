## To Do List
  1. Add MIDI to vector code
  2. data processing pipeline - ensure propagation melody_input time t+1 to all nodes
  3. Implement basic 1 layer LSTM network 
  4. design a cost function - use L2 norm to start


## Further generalizations:
   1. Make the LSTM part multilayer, using (partially?) dilated convolution as done in wavenet
   2. Add a RBM, deep generative or NADE layer (as in original paper)
   3. Add stylistic recognition & switching?
